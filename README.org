My solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 (yet to start), in Emacs LISP (or this is the plan. Let's see how it unfoldsâ€¦)

** How to install the code

Just clone the repository: it doesn't require any setup at all.

** What do you need

- Emacs (obviously) with the following packages installed:
  - buttercup
  - the 'dash' and 's' emacs packages
- make (optionally)

** How to run the samples

N/A (yet)
